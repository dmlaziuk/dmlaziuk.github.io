Creating personal blog based on GitHub.

[![Jekyll]({{ "/images/jekyll.png" | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}][Jekyll]

## Objective

I decided to start document every step I made during my learning path.

The other reason was to make a CV (Curriculm vitae) for interview.
A friend of mine said to me that I have to include CV in `.doc` format in placement letter.
I was shocked that I had to write a document in Microsoft Word in the 21st century.
I did it when I was at school and university in late 1990's.
Starting from Word 6.0 for Windows 3.1 and ending with Word 2000 for Windows 2000.
That's enough for me!

So instead I used GitHub with its ability to make personal site like `yourname.github.io`.
This service is called [GitHub Pages][GitPages].

You have to make new repository named `yourname.github.io`.
In my case it is `dmlaziuk.github.io`.

In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages supports [Jekyll][Jekyll] server.
It allows us to write pages using Markdown syntax, and use custom themes for styling.

In my blog I use [Minimal Mistakes][MM] theme.

      author_profile: true
      read_time: true
      comments: false
      share: false

{% raw %}
---
layout: archive
author_profile: true
---

<h3 class="archive__subtitle">
  {{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].recent_posts | default: "Recent Posts" }}
</h3>

{% for post in paginator.posts %}
    {% include archive-custom.html %}
{% endfor %}

{% include paginator.html %}
{% endraw %}
```

After installsation and configuration you can start Jekyll server locally:

```
$ jekyll serve
```

Then you can preview your site in browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

When everything looks great you just commit and push changes to GitHub:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
$ git push origin master
```

## Links

Now your site is available at `https://yourname.github.io`.
