In my 38 years old I decided to change my career from Building industry to Software engineering.

The reason is dissatisfaction.

So the most complicated thing is to make first step.
As I had some background in programming I decided to enter Java internship program in [SAM Solutions][SAM].
I wrote my first CV:

- **Age:** 38
- **Marital status:** married
- **English:** intermediate
- **Main programming language:** Java, C/C++
- **Hold position:** foreman
- **Developed projects:**
1. Keyboard trainer. **C/C++**
2. Construction reinforcement. **AutoCAD/AutoLISP**
3. English-Russian dictionary. **XML/XSLT/HTML**
4. Phonebook. **Java/Spring**
- **Skills/Technologies:**
  - C/C++
  - Java
  - HTML
  - Assembler
  - SQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Access
  - XML
  - DOM
  - Spring
  - TCP/IP
  - HTTP
  - MS-DOS
  - Windows
  - OS/2
  - macOS

I waited for feedback for almost two weeks and finaly entered Ruby couses at [Rubyroid labs][Rubyroid].

Nowadays I understand that I made the right decision.
Because choosing Ruby courses gave me ground knowledge in full-stack web-development, rather than some Java framework.

This was my first step.

I did it.
