Using John Somnez technique to learn Vue.js

[![10stepsIMG][10stepsIMG]{: .align-center}][10steps]

## Step 1. Get the Big Picture

What is the high-level topic that you want to learn about?  
_Learn Vue.js_

Briefly provide a summary of what your topic is about (the big picture.)  
_Vue.js is a JavaScript framework. It is one of three most popular frameworks: React, Angular and Vue_

Break your high-level topic up into smaller subtopics or focus areas:

- _Inline JavaScript in HTML. One component “app”_
- _Multiple components in single HTML_
- _Separate components in project tree_
- _Single Page Applications_
- _State management with Vuex_
- _Testing components_
- _Installing, deploying_

## Step 2. Determine the Scope

**Time frame:**  
_2 weeks_  
_8 hours per day_  
_2 x 5 x 8 = 80 hours total_

**Scoped Topic**  
What subtopic do you want to learn about?  
_Write Single Page Application_

What do you plan on doing with the knowledge you will get from learning about this topic?  
_Use it in my workflow_

Use the time frame, the subtopic, and what you will do with the knowledge to determine what will be your appropriately-scoped topic and write it here:  
_Write Vue frontend-application with Rails backend API_

## Step 3. Define Success

What specific actions does the knowledge you are trying to acquire allow you to do?

- _Refactor existing web applications_
- _Write own Vue components_
- _Use existing components_
- _Write modular web applications_
- _Write Single Page Applications_

Of the actions you listed above, which one or ones would be most valuable for you to be able to do?  
_Write Single Page Applications_

Using this information, come up with a clearly-defined success criteria that you will use to determine when you have reached your goal.  
_I will have learned to create Single Page Applications when I write my own SPA_

## Step 4. Find Resources

Start with books, since books usually contain the most well-researched and organized information. Look for the best 5 or so books you can find on your topic and list them here.

- [Vue.js: Up & Running][SafariUp]
- [Vue.js 2 Web Development Projects][SafariProjects]
- [The Ultimate Vue JS 2 Developers Course][SafariCourse]

Now make a list of all the other resources you can think of.

- [Vuejs.org][Vuejs]
- [Habrahabr.ru][Habrahabr]

## Step 5. Create a Learning Plan

List the chapters from the table of contents or the sections or headers used to break up the material.

**vuejs.org:**

- _Essentials_
- _Installation_
- _Introduction_
- _The Vue Instance_
- _Template Syntax_
- _Computed Properties and Watchers_
- _Class and Style Bindings_
- _Conditional Rendering_
- _List Rendering_
- _Event Handling_
- _Form Input Bindings_
- _Components_
- _Transitions & Animation_
- _Enter/Leave & List Transitions_
- _State Transitions_
- _Reusability & Composition_
- _Mixins_
- _Custom Directives_
- _Render Functions & JSX_
- _Plugins_
- _Filters_
- _Tooling_
- _Production Deployment_
- _Single File Components_
- _Unit Testing_
- _TypeScript Support_
- _Scaling Up_
- _Routing_
- _State Management_
- _Server-Side Rendering_

**Vue.js: Up & Running:**

- _Vue.js: The Basics_
- _Components in Vue.js_
- _Styling with Vue_
- _Render functions and JSX_
- _Client-side routing with vue-router_
- _State management with Vuex_
- _Testing Vue components_

Take a look at what chapters or sections are repeated the most and write them down here:

- _Installation_
- _Basics_
- _Components_
- _Transitions & Animation_
- _Rendering_
- _Routing_
- _Vuex_
- _Testing_

Add any additional modules or sections that you think need to be added to your learning plan, but might not exist as distinct chapters or sections in your resources:

- _Tools_
- _Deployment_

From both of these lists, come up with the modules for your learning plan. Put them in the order that makes the most sense to you:

- _Installation_
- _Basics_
- _Components_
- _Routing_
- _Tools_
- _Deployment_

## Step 6. Filter Resourses

What criteria do you think is the most important for judging the resources you will use for learning your topic? List the criteria you feel is most valuable to you here:

- _Contains real examples_
- _Contains ground knowledge_

Make your master list of resources here:

- _[Vue.js 2 Web Development Projects][SafariProjects] (for examples)_
- _[vuejs.org][Vuejs] (as reference)_
- _[Vue.js: Up & Running][SafariUp] (for ground knowledge)_
- _[The Ultimate Vue JS 2 Developers Course][SafariCourse] (video tutorial)_

## Step 7. Learn Enough to Get Started

What is the general idea of this module in your learning plan?  
_To build working web application_

What actions can you take to “play around” with what you are going to be learning for this module?  
_Take a look at some examples_

## Step 8. Play around

What specific things can you do to “play around” with the subject you are learning about?

- _Install Vue.js_
- _Run sample code in HTML < script >_
- _Run CLI tools_

Pick one of the things you can do and do it. Then list any questions you have as you are “playing around” here:

- _How to use Vue.js inline in HTML?_
- _How to separate one file to SFC — Single File Components_
- _How to use CLI: vue, vue-webpack-server, vue-loader?_
- _What is Webpacker?_
- _What is Babel?_
- _What is YARN?_
- _What is MVVM?_
- _What is W3C Components?_
- _What is Vuex?_

## Step 9. Learn Enough to Do Something Useful

What are the most important questions you hope to find answers to during this step?

- _How it works?_
- _How to use command line tools?_
- _How to put all components together?_
- _How to deploy Vue projects?_
- _How to transfer front-end projects written on Vue.js to Rails back-end?_

Which questions are still unanswered after completing this step?

- _How to implement Vue transitions and animation?_
- _How to use Vuex modules?_
- _How to deploy?_
- _How to implement server-side rendering with Rails?_

What do you think would be an effective way to teach what you have learned in this step to someone else?

- _To document all my actions_
- _To tell someone what I have learned_
- _To write in blog_

What is the most important thing you have learned in this step?

- _Custom HTML elements — are javascript objects, not HTML code_
- _Reactive features — is a process to work with Shadow DOM, render nodes and paste them to DOM_
- _All business logic put in Vuex!_

## Step 10. Teach

What methods of teaching do you find appeal to you the most? Do you like lectures, reading from books, watching videos, having a personal conversation, or something else?  
_Watch video course and write code by myself_

What do you think would be the best way to present the material you have learned in this module of your learning plan?

- _To document each step in README.md_
- _To have a conversation with coworkers_

Based on the answers from these two questions, determine how you will teach the subject matter you have been learning about and write it down here.  
_I’ll write a documentation and do a conversation_

After you have taught your subject, list anything you learned in the process that you had not realized or did not know before.
