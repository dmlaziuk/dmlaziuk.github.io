Ruby meet up is pizza, beer, tea/coffee, cookies and lot of fun!

It was my first meet up. Everything was interesting. But one thing inspired me.

In the lightning talks I've heard from one experienced ruby programmer that we have to develop not only our technical skills (T-shape), but Soft skills either.
At the same time doing my third homework I was looking for some technical books at [safaribooksonline.com][Safaribooks] and accidentally found [SoftSkills: The software developer's life manual][SoftSkills] by John Sonmez.
I wouldn't even have noticed that book earlier. But now I start reading it.

The blog you are reading is inspired by that two persons.
